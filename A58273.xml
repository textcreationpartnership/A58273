            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THat, hitherto I have ſent you no letters, think it not my Negligence, but the want of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new, or worth Obſervation, to Write: Within this few Days at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and there abouts, many ſtrange Signs have been ſeen in the <hi>Heavens,</hi> and to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperor himſelf; ſtrange Portent's happen'd one Night. Of all which I thought fit to give you an Account.</p>

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:65092:2"/>
On the 10th. of <hi>November,</hi> a moſt horrible Tempeſt aroſe, which continued in its Violence until, the 18th. vvith that fury, that ſeveral Trees vvere turned up by their Roots<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Houſes diſmounted of their Coverings, and many Elegant Structures level'd vvith their Foundations. Beſides the unuſual flaſhes in the Skies, the Emperors <hi>Palace</hi> was Rent, and many of his chief Miniſters periſhed by <hi>Thunder-bolts,</hi> and <hi>Lightnings,</hi> vvhich fell from the Skie: And that vvhich added more to their Horror and Terror, tvvo fiery <hi>Comets</hi> vvas ſeen, from vvhich tvvo Tails like Darts deſcended, or hung down, vvhoſe Flames ſo turned about, or brandiſhed, as tho the vvhole Air vvas ſet on Fire; which continued for one vvhole Night over the Emperours <hi>Palace.</hi> Three Hours before the day appeared it was ſeen over the Temple of <hi>Sophi.</hi> Beſides theſe Prodigies (the Language of <hi>Heaven</hi>) the <hi>Sultan</hi> in the Night, three hours before Day, in a Dream, did imagine that he was ſet upon by many <hi>Lyons,</hi> and by their exceeding Fury they had fixed their Tallons in his Breſt; from whence being overcome, with Terrour he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to Cry out, and by his ovvn Noiſe, awaked himſelf, which being heard, his Officers preſently ran to him, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Emperour was Aſſaſſinating: Being come, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the cauſe of his Diſturbance, which to one of his Intimates he Related. The <hi>Janizaries</hi> were commanded to their Poſts, being aſſured the Emperour was Well.</p>
            <p>Moreover, as he was ſlumbring, in the Morning, other Phantaſies occurr'd, as tho a great number of Centaur's was engaged in a Bloody Conflict amongſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>But afterwards from the <hi>Weſt,</hi> a like Body of <hi>Griffons</hi> who had the <hi>Eagle</hi> for their General, furiouſly falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65092:2"/>and Aſſaulting, the <hi>Centaur</hi>'s, preſently put them to Flight; part of which to ſave their Lives, fled and hid themſelves, the reſt were moſt Deſtroyed by the <hi>Griffons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> which <hi>Caeſar,</hi> Dreaming, ſaw, out of Commiſeration offered the <hi>Centaur</hi>'s a flaming Sword for their Aſſiſtance, which the <hi>Eagle</hi> their Captain ſuddenly ſnatch'd out of the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's</hi> Hand, and bore it away. The Emperour wakened, deſired to hear the Interpretation of theſe monſtrous Sights and <hi>Comets;</hi> for which cauſe over all <hi>Turkey</hi> the <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> and <hi>Magicians,</hi> under the greateſt Penalty and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Diſpleaſure, are commanded in Ten days time to come to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and are conjur'd in three Days time, without reſpect of Perſon, to render and declare the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe unuſual Prodigies and Sights; in purſuance of which Commands the <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> and <hi>Magies</hi> are joined in one Conſult; all being Examined they agreed in one Interpretation, but of their ſolution we are Ignorant, being only known to the Examinant.
